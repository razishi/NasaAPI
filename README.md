# html-template
A started template for HTML project.
Note that we organize the project in a way that is easy to maintain and understand:
- `css` folder for CSS files (although we are not expected to use CSS much)
- `js` folder for JavaScript files.
- `img` folder for images (you can also use internet images by providing the URL, but it is better to have a local copy)
The default file should be named `index.html` and should be in the root folder.
You can of course create additional HTML files and link them to the main file.



## Additional Information
We used a two-day delay this time, and in the previous exercise, we used a one-day delay. This means that we have used
a total of three days of delay out of the three days allocated.
This code manages a Mars Rover photo viewer, fetching data from NASA's API and displaying images based on selected
date, rover, and camera filters. It includes functions to show/hide loading spinners, fetch rover info and photos, 
filter results, display images, and manage a personal photo list (with options to add, remove, and describe photos).
Users can navigate between tabs, and the app resets filters and date inputs to their default state. The code ensures a
smooth, interactive experience for browsing and curating Mars Rover images.
